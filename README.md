# Code-with-me

A collection of Python and R scripts I've wrote.

In this repository, I’ve shared various assignments and tests I’ve completed using Python and R. Whether you’re a beginner or looking to enhance your skills, I hope these examples serve as a valuable learning resource. Feel free to explore, learn, and build upon them :)
