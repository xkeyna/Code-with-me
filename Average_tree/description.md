# Create average positive tree
Letâ€™s assume that only numbers will be stored in the tree. <br>
Write a function averagePositive(tree), which returns the average across all nodes with non-zero positive numbers stored in the
tree. The final result must be rounded to 4 decimal places. In order to avoid inconsistencies, there will not be test cases where the result before rounding is a number with 5 decimal places ending with 5 (e.g., 2.12345).
